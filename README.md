# pinger
Track ping RTT for a list of websites.

## Clone the repository
You can use the `go get` command to fetch this repository into your Go workspace source directory (typically `~/go/src/`).

`go get github.com/perryizgr8/pinger`

## Run the server
Start the server using `go run .`. This should fetch all dependencies and start listening on port 8080.

## Open the page
Simply point your browser to `localhost:8080` if you're running it on your PC/laptop. Or use your pi's IP address if you are running the server on the pi.
